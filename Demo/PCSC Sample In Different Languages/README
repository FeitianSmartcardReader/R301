PC/SC sample in different languages
The PC/SC API also called WinSCard can be used from a large variety of languages. I will start a serie of blogs to present the same program (functionnally) but using different languages.

Languages:
C
Perl
Python
scriptor
OCaml
Prolog
Ruby
Java
C#
Ada
PHP (dead upstream as 11 January 2015)
PHP5
lua
JavaScript (Node.js)
Python (using python-pcsclite)
Common Lisp
C for UEFI
Objective-C (using Crypto Token Kit)
Swift (using Crypto Token Kit)
go
Smart Card Connector on Chromebook
Rust
Objective-C (synchronous)
If you know a wrapper for a language not listed above please contact me.

Program
The program shall do:
connect to the first found smart card reader
send APDU: 00 A4 04 00 0A A0 00 00 00 62 03 01 0C 06 01
display result
send APDU: 00 00 00 00
display result
The first APDU is a SELECT command to select a test applet. The second command is the only command known by the applet.


Smart card Applet
The applet only knows one command and returns Hello world! (yes, it is a test applet). It was described in a French magazine GNU/Linux Magazine HS n¡ã39.
